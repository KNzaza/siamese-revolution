    <ul class="list3"><li>In October 1933, General Boworadet, a royalist, led a rebellion against the new government.</li>
    <li>His forces marched toward Bangkok, demanding a return to the absolute monarchy.</li>
<li>The government, led by Phaya Phahon and supported by young officers like Plaek Phibunsongkhram, successfully defeated the rebellion after heavy fighting.</li>
<li>The failure of the rebellion strengthened the People's Party, but it also caused deep divisions in Thai society between royalists and constitutionalists.</li>
<li>After the rebellion, the government became more cautious and faced political instability, including internal conflicts among Khana Ratsadon members.</li></ul>

    <ul class="list3"><li><p>Divided loyalties:</p> Many soldiers and officials still supported the monarchy, making it hard to secure control.</li>
    <li><p>Public awareness:</p> Ordinary citizens had little knowledge of democracy and were unsure whom to support.</li>
<li><p>Internal disagreements:</p> Members of Khana Ratsadon had different visions—some wanted gradual change, others wanted rapid reforms.</li>
<li><p>Royalist resistance:</p> Even before the Boworadet Rebellion, there were small uprisings and opposition groups plotting against the new government.</li></ul>
